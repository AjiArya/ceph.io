[Linode](https://linode.com/), the public cloud hosting company, is
the latest organization to join the Ceph Foundation as a General
member.

The Ceph Foundation, organized as part of the Linux Foundation, is a
collaboration between 34 industry companies and organizations that
provides an open, neutral forum for stakeholders to coordinate
their development and community investments in the Ceph project.

Since the Ceph Foundation was created in 2018, it has seen a steady
stream of new member organizations join its ranks.  In addition to
coordinating the yearly Cephalocon conferences, the Foundation's key
investments include a full-time technical documentation writer,
an expansion of the project's test lab, Windows driver support for
Ceph RBD and CephFS, and a recent website refresh.
