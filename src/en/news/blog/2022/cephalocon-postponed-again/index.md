We sincerely regret to inform the community that we have decided to postpone Cephalocon
2022 once again. We had hoped to hold the event, but many factors related to
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have had an unfortunate and major impact on our
efforts. Most notably, in recent weeks we have had numerous member companies
and a large portion of our community notify us they are still unable to travel.

Once the new plan is confirmed, we will be back in touch.
