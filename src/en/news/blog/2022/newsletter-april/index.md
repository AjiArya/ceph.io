## New Cephalocon Portland 2022 Update

[Cephalocon Portland
2022](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cephalocon/) has been rescheduled to
July 11-13th. The
[schedule](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cephalocon/program/schedule/) is
now available, and the
[sponsorship](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cephalocon/sponsor/)
prospectus is available.

### Scholarship Fund

The Ceph Foundation also has a scholarship fund intended to enable open source
developers and community members to attend when they would otherwise be unable
due to a lack of funding. We place an emphasis on funding applicants who are
from historically underrepresented or untapped groups and/or those of lower
socioeconomic status. If you work for a company that has the ability to fund
your travel, we ask that you not apply, to save funds for those that need it.
The
[application](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cephalocon/attend/scholarships/)
deadline is **May 20**.

## Google Summer of Code

Are you a developer that is interested in contributing to open-source? The
[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) gives people the
opportunity to contribute to projects such as Ceph with a 12+ week program
under the guidance of a mentor.

As of April 4th, contributor proposals are being accepted until **April 19th at
11:00 AM PT**.

Ready to contribute? [Register for
GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/register/contributor) and look at our
[available projects](https://ceph.io/en/developers/google-summer-of-code/) and
contact the mentor(s) listed.

## Ceph Developer Summit - Reef

Due to Cephalocon being postponed earlier, the Ceph Leadership Team has decided
on having a virtual summit on April 12-22.

We will continue discussions from the virtual summit at
[Cephlaocon's](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cephalocon/) in-person
summit on July 11th.

You can add topics for each
project-specific page listed in the
[etherpad](https://pad.ceph.com/p/cds-reef). We will have more announcements
on the schedule as things progress.

## Welcoming New Foundation Members

We are pleased to welcome two new Ceph Foundation members: [Arvan
Cloud](https://www.arvancloud.com) and [Seagate](https://seagate.com)!

Under the [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org), the [Ceph
Foundation](https://ceph.io/en/foundation) is a collection of members invested
in the development and progression of Ceph. The Ceph Foundation members
collaborate and pool resources to support the Ceph community and propel
innovation. Through combining industry leaders and associated parties, the Ceph
Foundation represents responsible and beneficial support, independent of the
technical direction of Ceph.

If you're interested in joining the Ceph Foundation, please contact
[foundation@ceph.io](mailto:foundation@ceph.io).
