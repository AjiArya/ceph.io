We can’t wait to gather the Ceph community again in person, and we’re sure
you feel the same way. We had hoped to do this April 5-7, but unfortunately,
given the current COVID-19 pandemic wave, we feel that this may not be the
right time to gather in person. We want to ensure a safe experience onsite
for participants, and make sure as many people that want to join us feel safe
in doing so. Thus, we’ve made the difficult decision to postpone Cephalocon
2022 until later this year. We are reviewing date options with the venue and
our partners, and will share the new event dates shortly. In the meantime, we
are excited to announce the [schedule](https://ceph2022.sched.com/) is live!
