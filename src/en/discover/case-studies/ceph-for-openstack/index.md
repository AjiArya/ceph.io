## The rise of OpenStack

For years, the desire to standardize on an open platform and adopt uniform APIs was the primary driver behind OpenStack’s rise across public and private clouds. Deployments continue to grow rapidly; with more and larger clouds, deep adoption throughout users’ cloud infrastructure and maturing technology as clouds move into production.

OpenStack’s top attributes are, not surprisingly, shared by the most popular storage software for deployments: Ceph.

With Ceph, users get all the benefits of open source software, along with interfaces for object, block and file-level storage that give OpenStack what it needs to run at its best. Plus, the combination of OpenStack and Ceph enables clouds to get faster and more reliable the larger they get. It sounds like a match made in heaven – and it is – but it can also be a challenge if you have your heart set on a DIY approach. Or worse, you could find yourself locked into a contract whose only interests being taken care of, are the vendor’s.

And, because OpenStack deployments vary drastically as business and application needs vary, there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach.
