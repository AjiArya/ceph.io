## You can run Ceph on anything, and anywhere: including an old war bunker

Sausage Cloud is a public-facing infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud platform with a strong reputation for supporting the open-source community. With a small team of like-minded volunteers dedicating their free time, they cater to the various needs of individuals and companies involved in developing and maintaining cloud compute infrastructure. Uniquely, Sausage Cloud’s entire infrastructure is housed in an old war bunker, located in the remote Cultybraggan Camp in Scotland, United Kingdom. Unsurprisingly, this presents the team with several challenges: a very small and remote space with very limited power.
