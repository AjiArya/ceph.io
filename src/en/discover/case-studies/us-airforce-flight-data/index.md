## Capturing flight data at the edge, for quick processing in geographically dispersed data centers

Eglin Air Force Base is a United States Air Force base in western Florida, and is the test and evaluation center for:

- Air Force air-delivered weapons, 
- navigation and guidance systems, 
- Command and Control systems, and 
- Air Force Special Operations Command systems. 

The Information Technology team at Eglin uses high-performance computing to analyze audio, video, and telemetry data from test
flights, and needed to consolidate their data on geographically dispersed production and dev-ops pods. With power, space, and
management issues specific to edge deployments, as well as sensitive, mission critical data on the line, Eglin's ICT team needed an efficient, secure, and supremely reliable storage platform. They found it, through the combination of Ceph, and SoftIron's HyperDrive.

## Answering the need for performance, power, space, and security
