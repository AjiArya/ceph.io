Google Summer of Code (g.co/gsoc) is Google's mentorship program for bringing
new contributors into open source communities. It's happening again for the
19th year in 2023! Over 18,000 developers from 112 countries have participated.

Google Summer of Code is a unique program where new contributors to open
source, ages 18 and over, are paired with a mentor to introduce them to the
open source community and provide guidance while they work on a real world open
source project over the summer. Projects cover a wide range of fields
including: Cloud, Operating Systems, Graphics, Medicine, Programming Languages,
Robotics, Science, Security and many more. GSoC Contributors do earn a stipend
to work on their medium (~175 hour) or large (~350 hour) projects. This is not
an internship but provides an invaluable experience and allows you to be part
of an amazing community!

GSoC is a highly competitive program, so don't wait to the last minute to
prepare! GSoC Contributors should reach out to the organizations that interest
them once orgs are announced on May 4, 2023. Potential GSoC Contributors can
apply at g.co/gsoc from March 20 - April 4, 2023.

See the list of projects we have available for GSoC contributors and [learn how
get started with contributions](https://ceph.io/en/developers/contribute/).

## Making Teuthology Friendly

**Mentor name(s):** Aishwarya Mathuria, Zack Cerza, Kamoltat Sirivadhna

**Mentor email(s):** amathuri@redhat.com, zcerza@redhat.com, ksirivad@redhat.com

**Difficulty:** intermediate

**Skills needed:** Python, Docker, FastAPI.

**Subcomponent of Ceph:** Teuthology

**Description of project:**
[Teuthology](https://github.com/ceph/teuthology/tree/master/docs) is Ceph's upstream integration test framework written in Python. It currently relies
heavily on users sshing into a teuthology server and execute commands to schedule, kill and update jobs.
This workflow requires a learning curve in memorizing and understanding all sorts of variables that makes up
a teuthology command. We are positive that we can improve this by creating API endpoints along with user-friendly UIs on Pulpito (Teuthology Frontend)
such that users can easily schedule and kill jobs through Pulpito.

**Standup/weekly call mentee could attend?**: Teuthology meeting

**Steps to evaluate an applicant for the project:**

Applicant should comfortable with creating simple API end-points and writting unit-tests.

## End to End Tracing

**Mentor name:** Omri Zeneva

**Mentor email:** ozeneva@redhat.com

**Project type:** 350 hour project

**Difficulty:** intermediate

**Skills needed:** c++

**Subcomponent of Ceph:** RGW, OSD

**Description of project:**
We currently have the infrastructure to create traces in the RGW and in the OSD separately, and then the traces are sent to the jaeger tracing backend. We would like to have traces representing a single operation, from the beginning in the RGW down to the OSD.

**Standup/weekly call mentee could attend?:** RGW, Core

**Steps to evaluate an applicant for the project:**

- Build and run a vstart cluster
- Upload an objet to Ceph
- Add a new span to an existing trace

## All Clients Deserve a Chance

**Mentor name:** Yuval Lifshitz

**Mentor email:** ylifshit@redhat.com

**Project type:** 350 hour project

**Difficulty:** intermediate

**Skills needed:** golang, java, python

**Subcomponent of Ceph:** RGW

**Description of project:**

We have several examples of how to hack the standard AWS clients to use out extended bucket notifications APIs. Currently we have such examples for python (using the boto library) - however, we need to keep them up to date with the recent changes in our code we are missing an example of how to hack the golang/java AWS SDK for the same purpose.

**Standup/weekly call mentee could attend?:** RGW

**Steps to evaluate an applicant for the project:**

- Build and run a vstart cluster
- Be able use the python boto3 SDK to upload an object to Ceph
- Be able use the Golang AWS SDK to upload an object to Ceph
- Be able use the Java AWS SDK to upload an object to Ceph

## Telesc√≥pio Lua

**Mentor name:** Yuval Lifshitz

**Mentor email:** ylifshit@redhat.com

**Project type:** 350 hour project

**Difficulty:** advance

**Skills needed:** C++, Lua

**Subcomponent of Ceph:** RGW

**Description:**
Enhance our Lua binding in the RGW to expose the content of an object when doing GET operations. The script should be able to process the object's content and overwrite it if needed. e.g.:

- Decrease image resolution based on client attributes, covert to black&white, or create thumbnails
- on-the-fly compression

**Standup/weekly call mentee could attend?:** RGW

## Visualizing a Ceph Cluster

**Mentor name:** Ernesto Puerta, Nizamudeen A

**Mentor email:** epuertat@redhat.com, nia@redhat.com

**Project type:** 350 hour project

**Difficulty:** intermediate

**Skills needed:**

- Python
- Angular/React/JS Frameworks
- Data Visualization (d3, plotly)

**Subcomponent of Ceph:** Dashboard

**Description of project:**

This project aims to provide users with a rich and interactive visualization of the status of a Ceph cluster. While Ceph already provides a high-level cluster status (HEALTH, WARNING, ERROR), that's often not enough when the cluster departs from the peaceful HEALTH zone to enter the shadowy WARNING or ERROR regions. In that situation, users will require a more fine-grained view of the status of the different cluster components.

[Reference](https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/50980)

**Standup/weekly call mentee could attend?:** Dashboard

**Steps to evaluate an applicant for the project:**

- Launch a containerized Ceph cluster (e.g.: rhcs-dashboard/ceph-dev)
- Access the Ceph Dashboard and the Landing Page
- Extend an existing chart to display a new performance metric

**What the first 2 weeks of work would look like during the internship:**

- Get familiar with the Ceph-Dashboard development environment and system architecture
- Understand how data flows from core Ceph to the Dashboard UI layer
- Identify the key data sources for depicting the status of a Ceph cluster
- Search Open Source charting and data visualization tools
