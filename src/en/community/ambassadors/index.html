              Wendy White began her career as a front-end web developer and multimedia project lead for Scitech, a cutting-edge interactive
              science museum. This ignited an interest in technical communication, and allowed Wendy to gain valuable insights into making
              complex concepts accessible to the general public across all forms of media. Wendy went on to craft technical documentation,
              user manuals, educational videos and training courses for a variety of organisations that required her ability to combine
              analytical thinking with clear, empathetic communication. Now, Wendy curates and creates technical content around Ceph as part
              of her role at SoftIron. In her free time, she writes interactive fiction using the open source visual novel engine, Ren’py.
