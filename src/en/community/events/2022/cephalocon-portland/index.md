We sincerely regret to inform you that we have decided to postpone Cephalocon
2022 once again. We had hoped to hold the event, but many factors related to
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have had an unfortunate and major impact on our
efforts. Most notably, in recent weeks we have had numerous member companies
and a large portion of our community notify us they are still unable to travel.

Once the new plan is confirmed, we will be back in touch.
