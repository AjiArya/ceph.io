## Diversity Scholarship

Cephalocon’s diversity scholarship program provides support to those from traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized groups in the technology and/or open source communities (including, but not limited to: persons identifying as LGBTIQ, women, persons of color, and/or persons with disabilities) who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend Linux Foundation events for financial reasons.

A number of scholarships will be provided and recipients will receive up to $2500 to reimburse actual travel expenses. Please note that you will be responsible to arrange and reserve your hotel and flight directly. You will then be reimbursed up to the maximum stipend amount of $2,500 USD after the event. The stipend may only be used for the following: economy class airfare, hotel/accommodations (up to three nights), and ground transportation (to and from the airport). Recipients will receive a complimentary conference registration, and meals provided during the event.

Scholarships are awarded based on a combination of need and impact. Selection will be made by an assembled group of reviewers who will assess each applicant’s request. All application information will be kept confidential.

Applications will be accepted through March 29, 2019. Announcements will be sent by April 10, 2019.

- **Application Deadline**: Monday, April 1st
- **Notification Deadline**: Wednesday, April 10
