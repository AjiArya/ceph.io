## Bringing Ceph to Poland

Come find out why leading enterprises are adopting Ceph, why Ceph is the lowest cost per gig storage solution, and how easy it is to deploy your own Ceph cluster!

### Event description

A full-day event dedicated to sharing Ceph’s transformative power and fostering the vibrant Ceph community, Ceph Day Poland is hosted by Hotel ibis Styles, the Ceph community, and our friends.

The expert Ceph team, Ceph’s customers and partners, and the Ceph community join forces to discuss things like the status of the Ceph project, recent Ceph project improvements and roadmap, and Ceph community news. The day ends with a networking reception, to foster more Ceph learning.

## CFP is now closed.
