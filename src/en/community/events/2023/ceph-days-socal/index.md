### Bringing Ceph to SCALE

A full-day event dedicated to sharing Ceph’s transformative power and fostering
the vibrant Ceph community co-located at <a
href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x">SCALE</a> - The Southern
California Linux Expo.

The expert Ceph team, Ceph’s customers and partners, and the Ceph community
join forces to discuss things like the status of the Ceph project, recent Ceph
project improvements and roadmap, and Ceph community news. The day ends with
a networking reception, to foster more Ceph learning.

The CFP is now open. Space is limited, so register soon.
