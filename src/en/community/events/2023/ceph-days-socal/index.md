A full-day event dedicated to sharing Ceph’s transformative power and fostering

   <td><strong>A day in the life of a ceph incident</strong>
<p>
On a long enough timeline, every system will eventually go down. This then creates a situation where an organization experiences an incident. In this session, we will discuss a Ceph incident we experienced, the timeline of events, how it was triggered, what we've learned, and how we've made decisions to improve.

   <td><strong>Crimson Project Update</strong>
<p>
ceph-osd's threading model makes heavy use of thread pools and work queues resulting in latency and cpu overhead which makes it very hard to exploit high performance storage devices. Crimson is a re-implementation of the ceph-osd daemon which replaces those mechanisms with a per-core user space scheduler to keep processing for an IO local to a core in order to minimize context switching overhead. This talk will discuss the current state of crimson in the Reef release.

   <td><strong>Integrating third party software in Ceph Testing</strong>
<p>
In this talk we discuss how third party software modules are integrated with ceph components. The main aim to do this is to test every component as a group. This helps us find problems when different software modules interact with each other. We’d discuss how this testing is done in Ceph using its test automation framework (i.e) Teuthology. This includes how a task is written in order to get it tested in the environment.

   <td><strong>Ceph from a Gentoo packager's perspective</strong>
<p>
Ceph is a complex piece of software, written in multiple programming languages with dozens of dependencies, many of them bundled in the source tarball.
<p>
This talk will go over some of the challenges presented in packaging Ceph. Much of the talk will be applicable to many distributions, as many have similar policies related to bundling of dependencies and internet access at build time. There are some challenges that are specific to Gentoo, such as supporting multiple Python releases at once.
